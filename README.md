TypeFocus
=========

TypeFocus is a minimal and fully-reponsive clean blogging theme for wordpress.

What it is?
===========

* Customizable wordpress theme, built using underscores and HTML5
* Built for readability. Typography is key.
* Fully responsive – adapts to Desktop, Tablet, and Phone sizes
* Customizable author-image, disclaimer-section, social-icons, and footer-copyright sections
* Ultra-fast, removed all the un-needed code. I’m a stickler for clean code, and you can see that here.

What it is not?
===============

* A theme for a company or a commercial organization to sell products. (It can be customized to do this, but thats not what it was created for)
* A theme with dazzling colors, and cheesy animations. (Seriously, this is a blogging theme.. its meant for content-emphasis and typography)
* Restricted: Its not a restricted-theme by any means. Take it, use it for anything you want, copy the source-code, templates, functions, hooks, style-sheet .. its Free. However, don’t samsung me – make something better with it, and don’t copy it as-is.  Underscores, Fontawesome, and Typefocus are all released under GPL. So it should carry the GPL license, and remain free.

Credits
=======
Underscores and Fontawesome are both great. I use font awesome for social-icons on this theme. They don’t require credits, but they deserve it. So if you can, please provide a link back to their page.
